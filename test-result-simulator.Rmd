### Configure the Simulation

Enter the (_**unknowable in reality!**_) conversion rates for **A** and **B** below (if we _only_ ran **A** or _only_ ran **B** for _all_ traffic for all time and _all other contributing factors were held constant_):

```{r}
# Conversion Rate for A
div(style="text-align: center;",
    div(style="display:inline-block; padding-right: 5px; font-weight: bold; font-family: Lato", "A:"),
    div(style="display:inline-block; font-family: Lato;", numericInput("rate_a", label = NULL, value = 5.0, width = "100px")),
    div(style="display:inline-block; padding-left: 5px; font-weight: bold; font-family: Lato", "%"))
```

```{r}
# Conversion Rate for B
div(style="text-align: center;",
    div(style="display:inline-block; padding-right: 5px; font-weight: bold; font-family: Lato", "B:"),
    div(style="display:inline-block; font-family: Lato", numericInput("rate_b", label = NULL, value = 5.5, width = "100px")),
    div(style="display:inline-block; padding-left: 5px; font-weight: bold; font-family: Lato", "%"))
```

How many visit(or)s experienced **each variation** of the test?

```{r}
# Number of visitors
div(style="text-align: center;",
    div(style="display:inline-block",
        sliderInput("num_observations",
                    label = NULL,
                    min = 1000, max = 100000, value = 25000, step = 1000)))
```

_Click below to simulate a test (a new simulation will automatically run if any of the parameters above are updated)._

```{r}
div(style="text-align: center;",
    div(style="display:inline-block",
        actionButton("run_test", "Run a Simulation!")))

```

### Annualize the Revenue Impact

_To experiment with estimating the revenue impact ("estimating the treatment effect"), we need some additional information:_

For how many days did the test run?

```{r}
# Test duration
div(style="text-align: center;",
    div(style="display:inline-block",
        numericInput("test_duration", 
                     label = NULL, value = 14,
                     width = "100px")))
```

What's the average order value (AOV) for the site?

```{r}
# Test duration
div(style="text-align: center;",
    div(style="display:inline-block",numericInput("aov", 
                                                  label = NULL, value = 100,
                                                  width = "100px")))

### Overview and Purpose

This simulator is designed to illustrate -- through calculations and simulation -- the difference between an _observed_ result in an A/B test and the _actual/true value_ _**(which is completely unknowable, but extremely useful to think about)**_.

Row {data-height=500}
-----------------------------

### Visualizing the Results

In the real world, we don't know the _actual_ values for **A** and **B**. We just know what we _observed_. If we did know the actual values, and we knew how many visitors we would have (which we've entered at left), then we could predict where the _observed_ values would fall. That's what the distributions are representing -- the magic of simulations in which we can see the normally unseeable.

```{r}

# Show the distributions
plotOutput("main_plot")

```


Row
-----------------------------

### Assessment #1: Detecting the EXISTENCE of an Effect

Does the observed difference in **A** and **B** indicate that the two variations are truly different? (This is the question that sample size calculators generally focus on: _detecting an effect_ only).


Row {data-height=260}
-----------------------------

### Check for Statistical Significance {data-width=667}

```{r results_assess}
# Output the summary explanation. This is built up with all of the
# formatting in the summary_message output.
uiOutput("summary_message")

```

### Which Means We Have a... {data-width=333}

```{r results_viz, fig.height = 1}

plotOutput("result_type")

```


Row
-----------------------------

### Assessment #2: Estimating the SIZE of the Effect

Can you simply use the observed difference in **A** and **B** to estimate the annualized impact of the winning variation? You can...but that can be risky, as it will overstate or understate the "true" value, and it may do so by quite a bit (while also assuming all other factors remain constant, which is never the case).

Row {data-height=250}
